# --- Hack.Diversity React/Redux Template ---

## Getting Started
Wondering how to get this thing working? Well, do we have the READMEs for you!
- [server](server/README.md)
- [client](client/README.md)

## Development Workflow
- Open at least 2 terminal windows/tabs, all of which starting from the root directory of this project (i.e. `~/your/local/path/to/template-react-express-monorepo`).
- In one of those windows/tabs, navigate to the `client` directory and run `yarn start`
```sh
cd client/ && yarn start
```
- In another one of them, navigate to the `server` directory and run `yarn server`
```sh
cd server/ && yarn server
```
- You should then see the frontend of the app by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/` in a web browser
- You can also ping the server directly at `http://localhost:3000/`, such as `http://localhost:3000/api/items`
